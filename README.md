# For this challenge, we were to:
#Create a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:
    #The ticker symbol
    #Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
    #The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
    #The total stock volume of the stock.
    #Add functionality to your script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume".
    #Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every year) at once.

#I have saved a text file with just my VBA code.

#I used this webiste to help me figure out how to run the code on all sheets in the workbook.
